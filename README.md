# IPFS
I have used the library ipfs-http-client to be able to complete the optional part of the project. This library allows controlling an IPFS node through Javascript.

More info on: https://docs.ipfs.io/reference/js/api/#ipfs-and-javascript and https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipfs-http-client

# Front end
For the front end, I used truffle webpack box as a template and then built on top. The boilerplate code was too old, and updating it would have taken much more time than simply using this template.
